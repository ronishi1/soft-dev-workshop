      <p>Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?
        I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. We can fix anything.
        We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let all these things just sort of happen. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.
        Anything you want to do you can do here. This is truly an almighty mountain. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Anyone can paint.
        Happy painting, God bless. All those little son of a guns. It all happens automatically. There he comes. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.
        You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Now then, let's play. Just let these leaves jump off the brush If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.
        Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. We have a fantastic little sky! You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.
